# Project Goal
This is my own personal website. With this project I aim to reach more people about my life, my skills, projects and experience through a responsive website.
*** 
# Used technologies
For the development of this website I used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4
* Typed.js library from [@mattboldt](https://github.com/mattboldt)
* Javasscript was also used to verify devices on '/pages/hoja-de-vida.html'
***
# Prerrequisites
The website can be accessed through this [link](https://jsbravo-sw.github.io/).

However, if you are willing to download it you must download the project and deploy it in `localhost` due to CORS policy with /lib/typed.js as a file and not a online resource.
